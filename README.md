# README #

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get your application up and running.

...but it's not.

### What is this repository for? ###
gps3 is a python3 interface for gpsd.

gpsd (http://www.catb.org/gpsd/) is a fabulous application that deserves a Python3 interface.

The goal is to deliver a package to the Cheese Shop (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/gps3/0.1a1)

It is a match made in heaven.
